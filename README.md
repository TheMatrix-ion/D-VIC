# DVISREpo

This toolbox allows the implementation of the following diffusion-based clustering algorithms on synthetic and real datasets included in the repository:

- Learning by Unsupervised Nonlinear Diffusion (LUND)
- Multiscale Learning by Unsupervised Nonlinear Diffusion (M-LUND)
- Spatially Regularized Diffusion Learning (SRDL)
- Multiscale Spatially Regularized Diffusion Learning (M-SRDL)
- Diffusion and VCA-Assisted Image Segmentation (D-VIS)
- Active Diffusion and VCA-Assisted Image Segmentation (ADVIS)

This package can be used to generate experiments in the following articles:

1. Polk, S. L., Cui, Kangning, Plemmons, R. J., & Murphy, J. M. "Clustering Highly Mixed Hyperspectral Images Using Diffusion and VCA-Assisted Image Segmentation." To Appear.
2. Polk, S. L., Cui, Kangning, Plemmons, R. J., & Murphy, J. M. "Active Diffusion and VCA-Assisted Image Segmentation of Hyperspectral Images." To Appear

The following scripts (in the Experiments folder) generate the relevant experiments:

- DVIS_demo.m evaluates the D-VIS clustering algorithm on four benchmark hyperspectral images. This script can be used to replicate experiments that appear in article 1.
- ADVIS_demo.m compares the ADVIS active learning algorithm against the D-VIS clustering algorithm . This script is used for experiments that appear in article 2.

Real hyperspectral image data (Salinas A, which was used in articles 1-4, as well as Indian Pines, Jasper Ridge, and Pavia Centre, which were used in article 1.) can be downloaded at the following links:
